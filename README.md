Expanding upon the weather concept, and drawing from my passion to travel and explore the world
I conceptualized, UI/UX designed and coded this React App which depends on connecting two completely unrelated APIs
one for weather conditions and one for photo search
and linking them together to provide an engaging user experience 
by providing a custom background with an iconic picture of the given city
as well as some adjustments to employ js logic to calculate the local time in the chosen city 
based on the provided api timezone information
and looping over custom css filters to paint the sky according to the weather conditions 
(rainy, snowy, etc..) which gives the user an authentic experience and "feel" when they interact with the app
